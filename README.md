# React-Native (Typescript) - Examine Your Mood!

This is an application helping you gain awareness of what mood you are currently feeling throughout the day. It's meant to be a quick "quiz-like" application that displays your current mood at the end of the quiz. It's meant to be very easy to use and be expanded on to make other "quiz-like" applications easily.
